# Movie Genre Classifier

This project is a movie genre classifier that determines whether a given movie description is more likely to be a horror or a romantic movie. The classifier is built using a neural network model trained on TF-IDF vectors of movie descriptions.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains the neural network model, and provides a Streamlit app for user interaction.
- `movies.csv`: The dataset containing movie descriptions and their corresponding genres.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- streamlit

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow streamlit# Movie_classifer
